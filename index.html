        <div>
            <p>
                Build strength and fitness - Learning BJJ involves fun and high-intensity pyhsical activity.
                You will notice your cardio, strength and endurance improve a great deal!
            </p>
            <p> 
                Learn Self Defence -The fundamentals of BJJ are well-rounded instructions on excellent
                self-defence mechanisms. Where other martial arts focus on punching and kicking,
                the fundamentals of BJJ teach us that the most effective way to defend yourself is to close distance
                and control your opponent. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Join an encouraging and supportive community - BJJ is not just a sport, for many it is a lifestyle! 
                It is incredibly fun and appeals to everyone in all walks of life. Not only is it addictive, its fun!
            </p>
            <p>
                Improve your problem-solving skills - Think of BJJ as a pysical game of chess. In chess, you cannot make
                a calculated move without anticipating your opponents next step. This makes BJJ not only a workout for the 
                body, but also the mind! Regular training not only enhances your problem-solving skills, but also your 
                ability to operate under pressure.
