# Brazilian jiu-jitsu Dublin

### Project Overview

The aim of this project is to be used as a hub of information on Brazilian jiu-jitsu clubs based in Dublin city centre. The project also includes basic information on the history of the sport and some inspiration for newcomers to begin their jiu-jitsu journey! As the project includes information on clubs based in Dublin along with their address and links to social media, it is also intended to be used by people who have trained elsewhere before and have recently moved to Dublin and are looking for nearby gyms where they can train.

### Bugs and Fixes

- As seen in the "Love Running" CI project - I encountered that issue where my nav elements had their order reversed when i set the items to float right. After some googling, I found that the fix was to float the parent of the listed nav items to the right and then, set the li elements beneath to float to the left. 

- I encountered an issue when inserting the small black belt logo appearing under the nav bar whereas the background did not blend well with the site background. In order to maintain the page layout (starting from white through blue, purple, brown and black) I researched different shades of white using hex values until I found the perfect shade.
