# BJJ Hub - Dublin

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to be used as a hub of information on Brazilian jiu-jitsu clubs based in Dublin city centre. As the project includes information on clubs based in Dublin along with their address and links to social media, it is also intended to be used by people who have trained elsewhere before and have recently moved to Dublin and are looking for nearby gyms where they can train.

For future updates to the project, I would like to include a news section that includes up to date information on clubs based in Dublin and upcoming competitions. I would also like to include a news section that relates to the global BJJ community, to include upcoming matches with popular grapplers and also sales on instructional videos online. I would also like to include a section including articles written by the wider BJJ community on subjects such as conditioning and nutrition.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

1. First Time User Goals
    * As a first time user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about BJJ as a hobby.
    * As a first time user, I want the site to be intuitive and user friendly so I can easily navigate the site and obtain the information I need easily.
    * As a first time user, I want information on BJJ clubs in Dublin. A brief note on the club itself along with their address and links to their social media so I can make an informed decision as to what club I would like to join. 

2.  Returning User Goals
    * As a returning user, I would like to see information on new clubs opened in Dublin.
    * As a returning user, I would like to have a platform where I can ask questions regarding clubs to better inform my decision.
    * As a returning user, I would like the up to date information on clubs. For example if a club has changed location.

3. Frequent User Goals
    * As a frequent user, I want to receive up to date news on any seminars, upcoming competitions or open mats taking place in Dublin.
    * As a frequent user, I want to be able to read articles written by the wider BJJ community on subjects such as conditioning and nutrition.

### Design

1. Colour Scheme
    * The colour scheme represents the five belt levels in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu; white, blue, purple, brown, black. It starts at white in the header, then sections in the order of blue, purple and brown with the footer being black.

2. Typography
    * The Roboto-Condensed family is used in the header text and section titles with Nunito being used in the individual section content. Sans-serif is set as the fallback font in every case in case the other fonts cannot be imported correctly. Roboto-Condensed and Nunito are used as they are clean, sleek and modern looking.

3.  Imagery
    * Various images of the inside of a BJJ gym are used as hero images on the home page and inquiries page. As the video used at the top of the home page shows BJJ in action and rather intensely at that, I felt that some calmer images that were still relevant would be more appropriate and welcoming for users. A background image of BJJ practitioners demonstrating a throw is used on the "thank you for your query" page which is intended as a show of what is in store for users interested in practicing the sport.

4. Video
    * A video embedded from YouTube displaying a diverse range of BJJ practitioners competing. The song playing over the video is "Don't Let Me Down" by The Chainsmokers feat. Daya. The reason behind this video being included is to function as a sort of "highlight reel" to show people what they will be learning should they begin training themselves

### Bugs and Fixes

- As seen in the "Love Running" CI project - I encountered that issue where my nav elements had their order reversed when i set the items to float right. After some googling, I found that the fix was to float the parent of the listed nav items to the right and then, set the li elements beneath to float to the left. 

- While writing the media queries for smaller devices, I was having an issue where a lot of white space was appearing beneath the footer. To fix this, I added the overflow: hidden property to my footer to apply only when the screen size is below a certain size.

- As the reader will see from the included wireframes, it had originally been intended that a "history of bjj" page would be included on the site. However, as this page was comprised of just one large block of text, I felt that this was somewhat disruptive to the flow of the project and also less relevant to the purpose of the site as compared to other pages. In future updates, I would like to re-introduce the page to the site, albeit with the text displayed in a way that flows better and is easier digested by users.
