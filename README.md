# Brazilian jiu-jitsu Dublin

### Project Overview

The aim of this project is to be used as a hub of information on Brazilian jiu-jitsu clubs based in Dublin city centre. The project also includes basic information on the history of the sport and some inspiration for newcomers to begin their jiu-jitsu journey! As the project includes information on clubs based in Dublin along with their address and links to social media, it is also intended to be used by people who have trained elsewhere before and have recently moved to Dublin and are looking for nearby gyms where they can train.
