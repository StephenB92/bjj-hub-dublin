                <h1>A brief history of the gentle art, from the samurai to the UFC Champions.</h1>
                <p>
                    Brazilian jiu jitsu has evolved throughout nearly a century to truly become a sport of the world.
                    BJJ is unique in the sense that it does not stem from one single point in history or one single
                    person.
                    It is also continuously growing and developing today, therefore creating one of the richest
                    histories in the sport world.

                <h4>Origins</h4>
                <p>
                    Before jiu jitsu even came to Brazil, it all started in Japan. In 1882, Jigoro Kano founded his
                    martial
                    arts school, Kodokan, with a jiu jitsu focus. Decades later, a student of Kodokan, Mitsu Maeda,
                    traveled across the
                    world down to Brazil. It was there Maeda met Gastão Gracie and his son, Carlos. Carlos became a
                    student of Maeda,
                    learning all about the practice of jiu jitsu. He later shared these lessons with his brothers. From
                    there, the Gracie family
                    adjusted aspects of the sport by making it more applicable and useful for everyone. Brazilian jiu
                    jitsu was born.
                </p>

                <h4>Moving to the U.S. and the creation of the UFC</h4>
                <P>
                    Rorion Gracie, the son of an original Gracie sibling, Héilo, immigrated to the United States in the
                    1970s.
                    With him, he brought Brazilian Rorion. Just bringing the sport to the country was not enough,
                    though.
                    Rorion met a business partner and together they created the first Ultimate Fighting Championship in
                    1993.
                    Rorion had a point to prove that BJJ was the best, so he had his brother Royce come and
                    represent this style among the competitors. Royce, a slender man who fought someone nearly 70 pounds
                    heavier, won
                    the tournament and proved to everybody BJJ was here to stay.
                </P>

                <h4>BJJ Today</h4>
                <p>
                    Jiu jitsu today spans across the entire sports industry. It is heavily used alongside other martial
                    arts and has remained
                    a founding pillar in the UFC. Academies are spread throughout the world, giving anybody the chance
                    to learn and excel at
                    this sport. What Rorion proves is that the bigger and stronger competitor does not always win. The
                    technique and craft of
                    jiu jitsu created by the Gracie brothers provide the athlete with a multitude of areas they can put
                    to practice.
                    Strength, conditioning, cardio, flexibility, and more are all aspects within this sport. Brazilian
                    jiu jitsu opened
                    Pandora's box to a whole different type of martial arts that can be used by everybody — big and
                    small.
